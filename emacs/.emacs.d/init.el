;; Welcome to siraben's Emacs init file!
;; This is the first to be executed by Emacs.

;;; Code:

;; Always prefer the newest version of a file, even if the old one is
;; compiled.
(setq load-prefer-newer t)

;; Reducing garbage collection makes startup faster.
(setq gc-cons-threshold 50000000)

;; At least remove the eyesores while we wait.
